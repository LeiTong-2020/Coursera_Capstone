Predicting car accident severity

Introduction
	Car accidents are severe threatens nowadays for people’s safety. For most cases, car accidents are related to many conditions which can be avoided in 
  advance, thus predicting car accident severity is important for a wide variety of people. Firstly, car accident severity is related to road conditions, 
  light conditions etc., it can be helpful for traffic administrators to take efforts to improve traffic infrastructures. Secondly, based on all conditions 
  related to car accident, developing a model to predict car accident severity can be useful to bring up advices for drivers before they get into trouble. 
  More importantly, with the development of auto-driving in the future, a smart model should be built to avoid car accidents, deeper understanding of all 
  conditions related to car accident is required. 

Methodology
	To predict car accident severity, we have analyzed all collisions provided by SPD and recorded by traffic records from 2004 to present. Firstly, we need 
  to sort out locations of car accidents, “ADDRTYPE” can be an important condition, as it’s more dangerous at intersections or narrow roads. Secondly, the 
  number of involved people, injuries is necessary to estimate severity, here “PERSONCOUNT”, “PEDCOUNT”, “PEDCYLCOUNT”, “VEHCOUNT”, “INJURIES”, 
  “SERIOUSINJURIES” and “FATALITIES” are included in our model. Thirdly, driver’s conditions also matter in accidents, “INATTENTIONIND” and “UNDERINFL” are 
  needed. Fourthly, environmental conditions is useful to predict possibility of accident in advance, “WEATHER”, “ROADCOND”, “LIGHTCOND” and “SPEEDING” are 
  included in our model. The target is to predict severity, thus “SEVERITYCODE” is used for our supervised model.
